            "history" : "Today Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675) is one of the most celebrated Dutch 17th century masters. Yet for centuries little importance was attached to his name. Works now known as Vermeers were attributed to other artists. It was only in the 1870s that he was rediscovered and 35 paintings identified as his. The son of a silk worker who bought and sold art, Vermeer lived and worked in Delft all his life. He may have served his apprenticeship under fellow townsman Carel Fabritius. In 1653, he joined the local artists guild, which he led at various times. Vermeerâ€™s early paintings of historical scenes reveal the influence of the Utrecht Caravaggists. His later paintings are meticulous compositions of interiors featuring one or two figures, usually women. These are intimate genre paintings in which the subject is engaged in some everyday activity, usually in the light of a nearby window. Vermeer could render the way light plays on objects like few others. The Rijksmuseum has three domestic interiors by Vermeer and one outdoor scene: his world-famous Little Street.",

            "history" : "Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was born in Zundert in Brabant, where his father was a pastor. His uncles were art dealers and Vincent began his career working for them. After several years in the art trade, he worked as a lay preacher in England and later devoted time to missionary work in Belgium. In 1880, he resolved to become an artist. At The Hague and Nuenen he painted still lifes, landscapes and scenes from village life in sombre colours.\nAfter a short period of study in Antwerp, Van Gogh moved to Paris. Influenced by Impressionism and Pointillism, he developed his characteristic style of separate streaks of paint and clear, vivid colours. In 1888, Van Gogh moved to Arles in the South of France. Mental illness led to several periods in hospital. Between these crises he continued to paint feverishly, until his death in 1890.",
